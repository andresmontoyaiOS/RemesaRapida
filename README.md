# RemesaRapida - Resilient Bill Payment Demo

RemesaRapida is an iOS demo application that showcases an **offline-first, resilient bill payment pipeline** built on top of the embedded `YunoChallengeSDK` Swift Package. Users can submit utility bill payments at any time — even without a network connection. The SDK queues payments locally, monitors connectivity, and automatically processes the queue the moment the device comes back online, applying exponential-backoff retry logic and idempotency enforcement to prevent duplicate submissions.

---

## Architecture

The project is divided into two layers: an **App layer** (the Xcode target) and an **SDK layer** (a local Swift Package). The SDK has no dependency on UIKit or SwiftUI and can be independently compiled and tested.

## Features

- **Offline-first queuing** — payments submitted without connectivity are persisted in `UserDefaults` and survive app restarts.
- **Automatic queue drain** — `PaymentSyncService` listens to `SystemNetworkMonitor.connectionUpdates` and processes the queue whenever the device comes online.
- **Exponential backoff retry** — transient `URLError` failures (timeout, no connection, connection lost, bad server response) are retried up to 3 times with delays of 1 s, 2 s, and 4 s.
- **Idempotency enforcement** — each payment carries a unique `idempotencyKey`. Once an approved key is recorded by `IdempotencyManager`, any retry resolves locally without a network call.
- **Network simulator** — `NetworkSimulatorView` lets developers toggle simulated offline/online state at runtime without requiring a real network change.
- **Deterministic mock API** — `MockPaymentAPI` derives outcomes from a hash of the bill reference, producing reproducible approved / declined / timeout / server-error scenarios across test runs.

---

## Requirements

- iOS 17.0+
- Xcode 16+
- Swift 6.0 (strict concurrency enabled in the SDK target)

---

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `RemesaRapidaApp.xcodeproj` in Xcode 16 or later.
3. Select the `RemesaRapidaApp` scheme.
4. Press **Command-R** to build and run on the simulator or a physical device.
5. Press **Command-U** to run the full test suite.

No API keys, environment variables, or external services are required. The project runs entirely with the embedded `MockPaymentAPI`.

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| YunoChallengeSDK as a local Swift Package | Provides clean separation of concerns: the SDK has no UIKit/SwiftUI dependency, compiles independently, and can be extracted into a standalone package or distributed via Swift Package Index without changes. |
| `@MainActor` on `YunoChallengeSDK` and `PaymentSyncService` | Guarantees that `@Published var payments` is always mutated on the main actor, satisfying SwiftUI's requirement for main-thread updates without manual `DispatchQueue.main` hops. |
| Actor-based `LocalPaymentQueue` and `IdempotencyManager` | Swift 6 strict concurrency eliminates data races at compile time. Actors serialize all queue mutations without explicit locking, making the code correct-by-construction. |
| Exponential backoff retry via `RetryPolicy` | Transient infrastructure failures (timeouts, connection drops, server errors) are retried with delays of 1 s, 2 s, and 4 s before a payment is permanently failed. Business rejections (non-`URLError`) are never retried. |
| `MockPaymentAPI` with hash-based determinism | The hash of `billReference` maps to a fixed outcome bucket, so the same reference always produces the same API response. This makes tests reproducible and lets developers predict behavior by choosing a specific reference string. |
| `SystemNetworkMonitor.setConnected(_:)` as a debug API | Exposes a controlled injection point for synthetic connectivity events. `NetworkSimulatorView` uses this to exercise the offline queuing and reconnection paths without requiring a physical network change or swapping the monitor implementation in tests. |
| `@Observable` on app-layer view models (not `ObservableObject`) | The `@Observable` macro (iOS 17+) provides fine-grained property observation: only the specific properties read by a view body trigger a re-render, reducing unnecessary work compared to `ObservableObject` + `@Published`. |
| Lazy view model initialization in `.onAppear` | View models that depend on `@EnvironmentObject` (e.g. the SDK) cannot be initialized as `@State` at struct creation time because the environment is not yet available. `.onAppear` guarantees the environment is injected before the view model is constructed. |

---

## Testing

The test suite uses **Swift Testing** (`import Testing`), the native testing framework introduced in Xcode 16. Key conventions:

| Annotation | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `@Suite("Name")` | Groups related tests under a named suite visible in the Xcode test navigator. |
| `@Test("description")` | Marks an individual test function. The string is the human-readable test name. |
| `#expect(expression)` | Asserts that an expression is `true`. Failures include the source expression in the report. |
| `try #require(expression)` | Like `#expect`, but throws if the expression is `nil` or `false`, stopping the test immediately. |
| `@Test("desc", arguments: [...])` | Parameterized test — the test function runs once per element in the arguments array. |
| `Issue.record("message")` | Records a test failure with a custom message without stopping execution. |

Tests use isolated `UserDefaults` suites (`UserDefaults(suiteName: UUID().uuidString)`) to prevent cross-test state pollution when exercising `LocalPaymentQueue`. Protocol-based mock types (`MockQueue`, `AlwaysApprovedAPI`, `MockNetworkMonitor`, etc.) are defined inline in `PaymentSyncServiceTests.swift` to keep the test dependencies explicit and self-contained.

---

## What I Would Improve With More Time

### 1. Real API integration
Replace `MockPaymentAPI` with an actual Yuno payment orchestration API. This would include authentication (OAuth2 / API keys), proper HTTP error mapping to `URLError` codes, and response parsing. The protocol-based design means this is a pure swap — no other layer changes.

### 2. SwiftData / CoreData persistence
`UserDefaults` works but has no query capabilities. Migrating `LocalPaymentQueue` to **SwiftData** would enable filtering, sorting, and pagination of payment history without loading the full array into memory on every access — important as payment history grows.

### 3. Background processing with `BGTaskScheduler`
Currently the queue is only drained when the app is in the foreground and connectivity is restored. Registering a `BGAppRefreshTask` would allow iOS to wake the app periodically in the background to drain pending payments, improving reliability for users who submit payments and then lock their phone.

### 4. Push notification receipt confirmation
After a payment transitions to `.approved`, send the user a local (or remote) notification with the payment confirmation details. This closes the feedback loop when the app is backgrounded during processing.

### 5. Biometric authentication before submission
Wrap `PaymentSubmissionView`'s submit action with a `LAContext.evaluatePolicy(.deviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics)` call. Financial operations should require explicit user authentication per platform guidelines.

### 6. Full retry queue visibility
Expose `retryCount`, next retry timestamp, and failure reason in the dashboard UI, not just the final status badge. Users should be able to see "retrying in 4s" rather than a static "failed" state.

### 7. Conflict resolution for multi-device scenarios
If a user has two devices and submits the same bill reference on both, the hash-based idempotency key won't help — the keys are different UUIDs. A real implementation would hash the business key (billReference + billType + amount) as the idempotency key so the server can deduplicate across devices.

### 8. Accessibility and localization
All strings are currently hardcoded in English/Spanish. A production app would use `LocalizedStringKey` throughout and support Dynamic Type, VoiceOver labels, and right-to-left layouts for the migrant worker markets the app targets.

## Dependencies

The project has **no third-party dependencies**. All functionality is implemented using Apple SDK frameworks:

| Framework | Used by |
|---|---|
| `Foundation` | All targets — `UUID`, `Date`, `Decimal`, `UserDefaults`, `JSONEncoder/Decoder` |
| `Network` | `SystemNetworkMonitor` — `NWPathMonitor` for OS-level reachability |
| `Combine` | `YunoChallengeSDK` — `ObservableObject` conformance for `@Published` |
| `Observation` | App-layer view models — `@Observable` macro |
| `SwiftUI` | All app-layer views |
| `Testing` | Test suite — `@Suite`, `@Test`, `#expect` |
